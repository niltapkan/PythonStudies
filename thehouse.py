'''
The House
----------
This is week 5 homework. Please complete the necessary functions.
Make sure the game is working properly before you submit. Don't
hesitate to make creative changes to the code. Also do not forget
to add comments to your code!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
STORY:
-Name- wakes up with a unbearable pain in the back of his head.
He doesn't remember how he got there. He's not sure how long he
was laying there on the floor. It is pitch black and he can't see
anything. He tries to turn on the light, but it doesn't work...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
TASK:
The player is trying to find a way out of the house. Every room 
has different tools that player can interact with. The player will
solve how to get out of the house by using the tools. The given
tools are merely suggestions, you can modify them to your liking.
Every room must have at least 3 different tools. The player can
only use one tool at a time. The tools can be either grabbed or
dropped. There is no limit to how many tools the player can keep.
The tools can be just story related interactions. 
Let's review an example of a room and the tools in it;
Living Room:
- Fireplace: Can be used to light the room, if there is an item that
can initiate the fire. (Unless there is light you cannot see what else
is in the room.) 
- Window: Give a creative description of the window and explain that
there is no way to escape the window.
- Blood: A blood stain on the floor. It is sticky and seems to go 
under the carpet.
    - Carpet: (Comes in the options only if the blood is examined)
    Can be lifted which reveals a key.
        - Key: Can be used to open the door to the hallway.
There will be a comment starting with "TODO" in the code where you
need to add your code. There are also hints in the code. You can
use the hints to help you complete the code.
100 Points in total, partial points are possible.
