# Make a list of names that includes at least four people.

# Modify your list so that there are only two people in it. 
# Use one of the methods for removing people from the list, don't just redefine the list.
# Run your if test again. There should be no output this time,

# o Jim is in a forest. It's been quite some time he hasn't eaten anything. He knows that he will get hungry soon. He knows that this side of the forest is full of delicious mushrooms. But he also is not good distinguishing poisonous mushrooms from delicious mushrooms.
# o Every mushroom in the forest has a code on it, a string of letters. Luckily, he has a list of codes, if a mushroom includes any of these codes in it's code, then it is poisonous. He needs to however check the mushrooms quickly since he doesn't have much time left. We are going to write a program that will check which mushrooms are poisonous and which are not. And count how many mushrooms Jim can eat.
# o The function is_poisonous takes a mushroom code as an argument and returns True if the mushroom is poisonous and False if it is not.
# o The function count_poisonous takes a list of mushroom codes and returns the number of poisonous mushrooms in the list.
# Sample Input:
# poisonous_codes = ['cod', 'arpe', 'xxyt', 'acr', 'bcd', 'xz']
# forest_mushrooms = ['htrcd', 'tarpes, 'xxytr', 'ceaar', 'vvbctd', vsxz', 'accr', 'ccod', 'ttyt', 'garxxytacr', 'ccd', 'xz']
# Sample Output:
# The forest contains: 12 mushrooms
# Number of poisonous mushrooms: 6
# Number of edible mushrooms: 6

# # Sample Input:
# # temprature = -35
